# üìò Product Requirements Document (PRD) ‚Äì AI-Powered Database Assistance & Documentation Platform

## 1. Overview

The AI-Powered Database Assistant is a SaaS platform designed to simplify and accelerate database-related tasks.  
It integrates with SQL & NoSQL databases to automatically **generate, optimize, and explain queries**, **document schemas**, **visualize ERDs**, and **create mock data**.  
The platform acts as a **copilot for developers, DBAs, and analysts**.

## 2. Goals

- Increase developer productivity by reducing time spent writing/debugging SQL.  
- Provide **zero-effort documentation** for databases (schema, tables, relationships).  
- Enhance collaboration within data teams via workspaces, versioning, and Git integration.  
- Reduce onboarding friction for engineers working with large/legacy databases.  
- Ensure enterprise-grade **security, compliance, and scalability**.  

---

## 3. Target Audience

- **Developers (frontend/backend/full-stack)** needing quick SQL queries.  
- **DBAs & Data Engineers** managing multiple evolving schemas.  
- **Data Analysts** querying data with limited SQL expertise.  
- **Tech startups, SaaS companies, and enterprises** managing complex data systems.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                   | Mitigation                                     |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| AI generates incorrect SQL              | Add guardrails + allow query preview before run|
| Data privacy concerns                   | Schema-only ingestion, no production rows      |
| Performance on large schemas            | Use embeddings & partial schema context        |
