# üöÄ Solo Developer Plan - QueryGenie
## AI-Powered Database Assistant with Multi-Role Support

### üìÖ Timeline: 16 Weeks | Part-Time Friendly (2-4 hours/day)
### üë§ Developer: Solo | Bootstrap Approach | Free Tier Services

---

## üìã Executive Summary

Building QueryGenie as a solo developer requires careful prioritization and a pragmatic approach. This plan focuses on shipping a working MVP with essential features, including a complete role-based access control system for team collaboration.

### Core Principles
- **Ship Early, Iterate Often**: Launch MVP in 8 weeks, enhance afterward
- **Use What You Know**: Next.js, PostgreSQL, simple patterns
- **Buy vs Build**: Use existing libraries (shadcn/ui, NextAuth, Drizzle)
- **Free Tier First**: Start with $0 infrastructure cost
- **Role System from Day 1**: Build multi-role support into foundation

### User Roles & Permissions
| Role | Database Connections | Query Execution | Documentation | Settings | Members |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|----------|---------|
| **Owner** | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Manage |
| **Admin** | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Limited | ‚úÖ Invite |
| **Editor** | ‚ùå View Only | ‚úÖ Full | ‚úÖ Edit | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå None |
| **Viewer** | ‚ùå View Only | ‚ùå View Only | ‚ùå View Only | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå None |
