# 💼 Business Model – AI-Powered Database Assistance & Documentation Platform

## 🧠 Problem
- Developers, data engineers, and analysts struggle with writing optimized SQL queries across different database dialects.  
- Database documentation is either missing, outdated, or too time-consuming to maintain.  
- Teams lack centralized, collaborative tools to manage schemas, generate queries, and document changes.  
- Legacy databases create onboarding friction for new engineers due to poor visibility into relationships and dependencies.  

---

## 🎯 Solution
A SaaS platform that integrates with SQL & NoSQL databases, automatically **documents schemas, generates optimized queries, creates mock data, and enables “chat with database” assistance.**  
The platform acts as a **copilot for developers & data teams**, reducing time spent on query writing, debugging, and documentation maintenance.
